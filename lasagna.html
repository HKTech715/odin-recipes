        <h3>Zucchini Lasagna Ingredients</h3>

        These are the basic ingredients you’ll need to make this zucchini lasagna recipe at home:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zucchini: </strong>Of course, you’ll need zucchini! Two large zucchini should make enough for
                eight
                servings</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>This zucchini lasagna is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh basil, fresh
                oregano, and fresh parsley</li>
            <li><strong>Beef: </strong>This recipe calls for ground beef, but you can use ground turkey for a lighter
                take
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Produce: </strong>Aside from the zucchini, you’ll also need a green bell pepper, an onion,
                and
                mushrooms from the produce aisle</li>
            <li><strong>Frozen Spinach: </strong>Frozen spinach is a convenient, colorful, and nutrient-rich ingredient
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tomato Products: </strong>A combination tomato paste and tomato sauce</li>
            <li><strong>Wine: </strong>Red wine enhances the overall flavor</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>You’ll need low-fat ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li><strong>Egg: </strong>An egg adds moisture and helps bind the ricotta mixture together, preventing
                runniness
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounces grated parmesan cheese</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <strong>Step 1</strong> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F(165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking
            pan.<br />
            <strong>Step 2</strong> Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt;
            set
            aside to drain in a colander.<br />
            <strong>Step 3</strong> To prepare the meat sauce, cook ground beef and black pepper in a large skillet over
            medium-high heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer
            pink.<br />
            <strong>Step 4</strong> Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, basil, and oregano; add a small amount of
            hot
            water if sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring
            frequently.<br />
            <strong>Step 5</strong> Meanwhile, stir ricotta, egg, and parsley together in a bowl until well
            combined.<br />
            <strong>Step 6</strong> To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared
            pan.
            Layer with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, all of the spinach, followed by all of
            the
            mushrooms, then 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering in the remaining meat sauce, zucchini
            slices,
            ricotta mixture, and mozzarella.<br />
            <strong>Step 7</strong> Spread parmesan evenly over the top; cover with foil.<br />
            <strong>Step 8</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to
            350
            degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes.<br />
            <strong>Step 9</strong> Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.<br />
            <strong>Step 10</strong> Serve and enjoy!<br />
